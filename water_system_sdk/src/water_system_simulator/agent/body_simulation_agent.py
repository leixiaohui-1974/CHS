    automatically generate the necessary control and sensing agents for its

    1. Live Digital Twin: When connected to real-world sensors, it uses data
       assimilation to stay synchronized with the physical asset.
    2. In-Loop Test Platform: When disconnected, it serves as a high-fidelity
       virtual environment for testing the agents it generates.
