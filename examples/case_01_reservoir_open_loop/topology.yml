# Case 01: Reservoir Open Loop Simulation
# This case demonstrates the response of a single reservoir to a varying inflow.

case_name: case_01_reservoir_open_loop
duration: 100 # hours
dt: 1.0
solver: EulerIntegrator

components:
  - name: reservoir1
    type: FirstOrderInertiaModel
    properties:
      initial_storage: 5000.0 # m^3
      time_constant: 100.0 # T, where Outflow = Storage / T
      # The solver class and dt for the model are passed by the engine
    connections:
      inflow: "inflow_disturbance" # Connects to the disturbance
      # t is passed by the engine

logging:
  - time
  - reservoir1.storage
  - reservoir1.output # This is the outflow
  - inflow_disturbance # Log the inflow to see the relationship
