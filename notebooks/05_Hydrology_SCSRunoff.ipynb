    "## 1. Theoretical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The SCS-CN method is an empirical model developed by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). It's based on the following relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Q = (P - Ia)Â² / (P - Ia + S)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `Q` is the direct runoff depth.\n",
    "- `P` is the total rainfall depth.\n",
    "- `Ia` is the **initial abstraction**, representing all losses before runoff begins (e.g., interception by vegetation, surface storage, infiltration). It is empirically related to `S` by `Ia = 0.2 * S`.\n",
    "- `S` is the **potential maximum retention** after runoff begins. It is related to the Curve Number (CN) by the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "S = (1000 / CN) - 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Curve Number (CN)** is a dimensionless parameter ranging from 30 to 100, which represents the runoff potential of an area based on its soil type, land use, and antecedent moisture conditions."

    "- `rainfall` (float): The rainfall depth for the time step.\n",
    "- `sub_basin_params` (dict): A dictionary containing the parameters for the basin. The model expects a `\"CN\"` key in this dictionary.\n",
