    "This notebook provides a guide to using the `WatershedDelineator` tool in the CHS SDK. This powerful tool automates the process of analyzing a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to determine drainage patterns and delineate watershed boundaries, which is a fundamental step in setting up most hydrological models."

    "\n",
    "The process of delineating a watershed from a DEM involves a standard sequence of GIS operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Fill Sinks**: Raw DEMs often have small imperfections that create artificial depressions where water would get stuck. This step fills these sinks to ensure a continuous flow path across the landscape.\n",
    "2.  **Flow Direction**: For each cell in the DEM, this step determines which of its 8 neighbors water will flow to, based on the steepest descent.\n",
    "3.  **Flow Accumulation**: This step calculates, for each cell, how many upstream cells flow into it. This is used to identify the stream network (cells with high accumulation values).\n",
    "4.  **Delineation**: Using the flow direction grid, this step identifies all the cells that flow into a specified **outlet point**, defining the watershed boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `WatershedDelineator` automates this entire workflow."
