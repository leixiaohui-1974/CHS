    "# Tutorial: Programmatic Simulation and Control\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the CHS SDK as a Python library to programmatically build and run a simulation. Unlike using YAML files, this approach offers maximum flexibility and is ideal for research, complex scripting, and integration with other Python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** We will create a simple closed-loop control system consisting of:\n",
    "1.  A **Reservoir**, represented by a `BodyAgent` with a `LinearTank` model.\n",
    "2.  A **PID Controller**, represented by a `ControlAgent`.\n",
    "3.  A **Logger**, a special agent that will record the reservoir's state for later analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the new state-reporting mechanism: the reservoir will report its state, and the PID controller will subscribe to these updates to get its feedback signal."
