    "This model solves the **Saint-Venant equations**, which are a set of nonlinear partial differential equations that describe the flow of water in an open channel. They are derived from the principles of conservation of mass and conservation of momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike simpler routing models (like the Muskingum model), the St. Venant model can simulate a wide range of dynamic effects, including:\n",
    "- Backwater effects (downstream conditions affecting upstream flow).\n",
    "- Wave propagation and reflection.\n",
    "- Supercritical and subcritical flow regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CHS SDK implementation solves these equations for an entire **network** of channels (`Reaches`) and junctions (`Nodes`), making it a powerful tool for complex system simulation."
