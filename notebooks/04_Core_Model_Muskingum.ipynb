    "## 1. Theoretical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Muskingum method is a simple and effective way to model how a flood wave changes shape as it moves downstream. It accounts for two key phenomena:\n",
    "1.  **Translation**: The time it takes for the wave to travel from the upstream to the downstream end.\n",
    "2.  **Attenuation**: The flattening and spreading out of the flood wave due to channel storage effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the model is the Muskingum equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "O_t = C1*I_t + C2*I_{t-1} + C3*O_{t-1}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `O` is the Outflow and `I` is the Inflow.\n",
    "- `t` is the current time step and `t-1` is the previous time step.\n",
    "- `C1`, `C2`, `C3` are routing coefficients calculated from the physical characteristics of the channel, represented by the parameters `K` and `x`, and the simulation time step `dt`."
