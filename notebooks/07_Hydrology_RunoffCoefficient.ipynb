    "## 1. Theoretical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The runoff coefficient method, also known as the \"Rational Method\" in some contexts, is the most straightforward way to estimate runoff. It assumes that runoff is a direct, linear fraction of the total rainfall.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Q = C * P\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `Q` is the direct runoff.\n",
    "- `P` is the total rainfall.\n",
    "- `C` is the **runoff coefficient**, a dimensionless value between 0 and 1. `C` represents the fraction of rainfall that becomes direct runoff. A value of 1 means all rainfall becomes runoff (like on a paved surface), while a value of 0 means no runoff is generated (like on very dry, porous soil)."
