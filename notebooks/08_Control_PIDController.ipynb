    "\n",
    "A PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller continuously calculates an **error value** `e(t)` as the difference between a desired **setpoint (SP)** and a measured **process variable (PV)**. It applies a correction based on three terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proportional (P)**: Proportional to the current error. A larger P term results in a stronger response to the current error. `P_out = Kp * e(t)`\n",
    "- **Integral (I)**: Proportional to the accumulation of past errors. The I term eliminates steady-state error by integrating the error over time. `I_out = Ki * âˆ«e(t)dt`\n",
    "- **Derivative (D)**: Proportional to the rate of change of the error. The D term predicts future error and can dampen the system's response, reducing overshoot. `D_out = Kd * de(t)/dt`\n",
    "\n",
    "The final controller output is the sum of these three terms. Tuning the gains `Kp`, `Ki`, and `Kd` is the key to achieving a fast, stable response."

    "- **Well-Tuned**: This controller provides a smooth, quick rise to the setpoint with minimal overshoot.\n",
    "- **Aggressive (Overshoot)**: The higher gains cause the controller to react more strongly, leading to the water level overshooting the setpoint before settling down.\n",
    "- **Oscillating**: With very high gains, the controller overcorrects so much that it creates sustained oscillations around the setpoint, never fully settling. This demonstrates an unstable control system.\n",
