    "This example is based on the case study described in `chs-knowledge-hub/docs/case_studies/cascade_reservoir_optimization.md`, but provides a complete, runnable implementation using the `SimulationManager`."

    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a system of two reservoirs in series (a cascade system). The outflow from the upstream reservoir becomes the inflow for the downstream reservoir.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Maximize the total energy generated by both reservoirs over a 24-hour period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** Simply releasing as much water as possible from both reservoirs might generate a lot of power, but it could also drain the reservoirs, leaving no water for future use, or violate water level safety constraints. The goal is to find a *schedule* of releases that produces the most power while ending the day in a good state."

    "The results show that the **'Peak Hours'** strategy yields the most power. The 'Drain Down' strategy produces a lot of power but may not be sustainable and violates the water level constraints (which a real optimizer would prevent). The 'Steady' strategy is safe but leaves potential energy on the table.\n",
