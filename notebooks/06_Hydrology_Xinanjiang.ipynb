    "## 1. Theoretical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Xinanjiang model is based on the concept of **saturation excess runoff**. This means that runoff is generated when the soil becomes fully saturated and can no longer absorb more water. This is different from the infiltration excess mechanism (where runoff occurs when rainfall intensity exceeds the soil's infiltration capacity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts of the model include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tension Water Capacity**: The model divides the soil into upper, lower, and deep layers, each with its own tension water capacity. The distribution of this capacity over the catchment area is assumed to be non-uniform, which is a core idea of the model.\n",
    "- **Three Soil Layers**: The model considers evaporation from three soil layers: upper, lower, and deep.\n",
    "- **Runoff Components**: The total runoff is separated into different components, such as surface runoff, interflow, and groundwater flow, which are then routed to the catchment outlet."

    "\n",
    "The `XinanjiangModel` in the CHS SDK implements the core runoff generation part of the model. Its `calculate_runoff` method uses the following key parameters, typically provided in a `sub_basin_params` dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `WM`: The average tension water capacity of the catchment (mm).\n",
    "- `B`: The exponent of the tension water capacity curve (dimensionless).\n",
    "- `IM`: The fraction of the catchment area that is impervious (dimensionless).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model also maintains an internal state:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `W`: The current tension water content of the soil (mm)."
