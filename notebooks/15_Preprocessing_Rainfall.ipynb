    "# Preprocessing Guide: RainfallProcessor\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a guide to the `RainfallProcessor`, a component designed for **spatial interpolation of rainfall data**. This is a critical preprocessing step for distributed hydrological models, which require rainfall inputs at specific points (e.g., the center of a sub-basin), whereas real-world data typically comes from a sparse network of rain gauges."

    "## 1. How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RainfallProcessor` is a special component that runs *before* the main simulation loop. It is designed to be listed in the `preprocessing` section of a simulation configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its workflow is:\n",
    "1.  It reads the locations and time series data paths for several **rain gauges** from the `datasets` section of the config.\n",
    "2.  It identifies all components in the simulation that need rainfall data (e.g., hydrological models) and gets their coordinates.\n",
    "3.  It uses a specified **interpolation strategy** (like Inverse Distance Weighting) to calculate the rainfall at each target location for every timestamp present in the gauge data.\n",
    "4.  The final result is a single DataFrame of interpolated rainfall time series, which can then be used by other models during the main simulation."
