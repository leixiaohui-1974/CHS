    "## 1. Intended Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrological simulations often require rainfall data for specific points (like the center of a sub-basin), but real-world data usually comes from a sparse network of rain gauges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RainfallProcessor` was designed to bridge this gap. Its purpose is to take data from multiple rain gauges and use a mathematical interpolation strategy (like Inverse Distance Weighting or Thiessen Polygons) to estimate the rainfall at any number of target locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process is intended to be run once, before the main simulation loop, to generate a complete rainfall time series for all necessary locations."

    "## 2. Current Status & Missing Components\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RainfallProcessor` class exists in `chs_sdk.preprocessing.rainfall_processor`. However, it requires an **interpolation strategy** object to be passed to its constructor. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `ComponentRegistry` in `simulation_manager.py` shows that classes like `InverseDistanceWeightingInterpolator` were intended to exist in a file named `chs_sdk.preprocessing.interpolators.py`. \n",

    "**This file is currently missing from the repository.**\n",

    "Without these interpolation strategy classes, the `RainfallProcessor` cannot be instantiated or used. The code below is a hypothetical example of how it *would* be used if the missing components were implemented."
